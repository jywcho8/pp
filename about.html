        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Sports Analyst | Data Enthusiast | Golfer</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Jason, and I am a sports analyst passionate about leveraging data to drive fan engagement, 
          operational efficiency, and business growth in the sports industry.</p>

        <p>I completed my bachelor's degree in California, and then joined my family's franchise F&B business in Korea. 
          After spending a few years immersed in operations and marketing, life took me on a different journey—one that 
          aligned more closely with my passion for sports.</p>

        <p>Since I was 14 years old, golf has sparked a deep-rooted passion for the sports industry within me. 
          That passion led me to fully commit to a career in sports. I've had the hands-on experience of coordinating 
          international golf tournaments, high-profile pro-am events, and charity events, each deepening my understanding 
          of what it means to connect people through sports.</p>

        <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a master's degree in Sports Administration with a specialization in Data Analytics 
          at Northwestern University. I'm focusing on transforming complex sports data into compelling visual stories 
          and actionable insights, particularly in golf and Formula 1. I believe the future of sports lies in understanding 
          audiences better through the power of data.<br></p>
